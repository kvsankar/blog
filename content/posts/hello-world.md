# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Why This Setup?

I wanted a blogging platform that:

- Lets me write in **Markdown**
- Stores content in **Git** for version control
- Is **free** for readers
- Gives me **full ownership** of my content

GitHub Pages + Hugo checks all these boxes.

## Adding Images

Images are stored in the repo and referenced with public URLs:

```markdown
![Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvsankar/blog/main/static/images/example.jpg)
```

This also makes cross-posting to Medium seamless!

## What's Next

I'll be writing about topics that interest me. Stay tuned!
